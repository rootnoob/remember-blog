Watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYRREjn29A) of one of the Home Office’s bully boys, it jigged my mind to that wonderful phrase “I’m just doing my job”. Despite not having actually spoken such, that was, in effect, what he said.

“No, I’m saying if he doesn’t pay it”
The bully seems surprised at the public outrage
“I’m warning him”
“I’m giving him a chance”

This bully probably thinks he is being kind to this individual. Mad that may be, given he threatened a £10,000 fine with spite: “I don’t think you’ll be able to afford”; but such is the nature of our society – mad.

From this particular bully’s reaction to public outrage, caught-out and surprised that somebody dare protest, it’s apparent he doesn’t really believe in the fines he is threatening.

What does this have to do, with ‘just’ ‘doing my job’ ?

Clearly, he had been ordered there. Clearly, he thinks he is being rather lenient – “I’m giving him a chance”; which gives us an insight into the ‘leniency’ of his colleagues, for therein lies the truth.

This bully does not think himself a bully, because there’s always a bigger bastard. He himself is unthinkingly subservient to some higher-paid jobsworth.

And so despite not speaking the words, his actions said them; this individual clearly thinks he is “’just’ doing his job”. Not having considered his words, pleading false-kindness “I’m giving him ‘a chance’”, after spitefully threatening a life-ruining fine This episode is significant as it enlightens us to the thinking of many who do speak those words.

Not merely do people not think about what they say – (why feel the need to profess what what you are doing is inconsequential?) – there is an implied understanding. This implicit understand of ‘just’ ‘doing a job’, is the ‘job’ element. This nuance is significant, and distinguishes the phrase from that of ‘just following orders’ – which many who profess they’re ‘just doing a job’ revolt saying.

It is in understanding this nuance of meaning, that we can begin to truly challenge the basis of this phrase, and its implicit understanding (because I don’t: “know what I mean”).

The basis of those who ‘just’ ‘follow orders’, as with those whom are ‘just’ ‘doing a job’, is fear. Ultimately, people like this think they are being ‘kind’ – because they are there on demand of people, superior to them, who are more militant – and less ‘kind’. Hence, they think they are “giving people ‘a chance’” – a most peculiar phrase; ‘a chance’ at what? closing ones business, sole source of income, ruining ones livelihood? They think this, because, their superiors (who hide away from the public), would not be so flexible.

And so, these unthinking order-followers are scared. And we must understand this fear, else it consume us all. It is far too easy to be ignorant of the worries of others, however nasty they may seem, for most evil is done out of fear. I think the individual captured in this footage is understandably scared, as many others are. Although they may not confess it, their actions speak for them.

Hence, we come back to the use of the term ‘job’. The tyrants of this country employ inflation to cripple those who carefully save their money. If you are not earning, you will very quickly be unable to live. Given that there is mass unemployment in this country, which the government figures attempt to hide, a ‘job’ is a relatively scarce thing to obtain.

You may think getting a job is easy, but what about keeping it? In our society of mass unemployment, workers are replaceable. If you don’t show absolute conformance to those who control your employment, (don’t make the mistake of thinking that we, the taxpayer, have that control any-longer), then they may just replace you with somebody who will – and there’s millions to pick from.

It is by understanding this reasonable fear, that we can be rational and crush it – for there is something far more scary. I am not scared of losing a job. I fear a society that is scared to speak its mind. I fear a society which creates mass unemployment; a society so scared of those richer and more powerful that it will enforce rules which destroy livelihoods.

The next time one of these scared individuals comes to your business, and they say “I’m ‘just’ doing my job”, question their logic: “But isn’t your job, destroying other people’s jobs?”. Don’t attempt to tell them they are wrong: A statement closes the mind, a question opens it.
