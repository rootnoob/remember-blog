Manchester Police Farce, (or whatever they're calling themselves these days), have a gift for all criminals nationwide, today; both muslim and non-muslim. "**Police treat mosque fire as hate crime**": see this [rag](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-58528886), from our most-noble National Truth Service.  

By investigating this, most idiotic and abhorrent, act as a 'hate-crime' they undermine the rule of common law; which many, both muslim and non-muslim, believe the state still upholds. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: If hate is a crime - then lock me up. We all hate something - perhaps you hate me*. If you do, (in a civilised country): it is your divine right to. Judging by the actions of Manchester Police Farce, The <s>United</s>Divided Kingdom, however, is apparently not a civilised country.  


As the subtitle rightly states:  
**HATE is a FAR GREATER offence, (to the state), than arson**.  

**Why is this?**  
Perhaps, (in my absurd and politically-incorrect opinon), it is because the state is formed of tyrants. 
And, as all tyrants do, they seek to divide the country for their benefit, (divide and ye shall conquer).  

As the alleged crime is arson, by refusing to even investigate, (letalone punish any offenders for said crime), **MPF may as-well hand-out free molotv-cocktails to all whom pass-by this mosque**. Alas, MPF appear to be spineless cowards - serfs to their political masters: (whom are set upon [integrating Islam into their tyranny](https://remember-blog.com/2021/03/10/the-rise-of-the-muslims-the-death-of-islam/)).  

If any alleged offenders are convicted of this crime and sent to to prison, you may think: Justice has been done. 
But has it, really? 
This entire incident has now been overshadowed by this cowardly surrender by MPF. 
It is difficult to see how any trial of the offender(s) could possibly be fair, and punishment apolitical. 
Unless, that-is:  
**Manchester Police Farce publicly admit their mistake, and show their sincere apologies by thoroughly investigating the apparent crime of arson and properly punishing any and all offenders caught**.  

**Will that happen?**  
That, I do not know; for I am a most humble journalist<s>cowardly keyboard-warrior</s>.
